Numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence are known as Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn. Many writers begin the sequence with 0 and 1, although some authors start it from 1 and 1 and some (as did Fibonacci) from 1 and 2. Starting from 0 and 1, the sequence begins:\\n\\n    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ... (sequence A000045 in the OEIS)\\n\\n    A tiling with squares whose side lengths are successive Fibonacci numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and 21\\n\\n    The Fibonacci numbers were first described in Indian mathematics as early as 200 BC in work by Pingala on enumerating possible patterns of Sanskrit poetry formed from syllables of two lengths. They are named after the Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, also known as Fibonacci, who introduced the sequence to Western European mathematics in his 1202 book Liber Abaci.\\n\\n    Fibonacci numbers appear unexpectedly often in mathematics, so much so that there is an entire journal dedicated to their study, the Fibonacci Quarterly. Applications of Fibonacci numbers include computer algorithms such as the Fibonacci search technique and the Fibonacci heap data structure, and graphs called Fibonacci cubes used for interconnecting parallel and distributed systems. They also appear in biological settings, such as branching in trees, the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the fruit sprouts of a pineapple, the flowering of an artichoke, and the arrangement of a pine cone\\'s bracts, though they do not occur in all species.\\n\\n    Fibonacci numbers are also strongly related to the golden ratio: Binet\\'s formula expresses the n-th Fibonacci number in terms of n and the golden ratio, and implies that the ratio of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers tends to the golden ratio as n increases. Fibonacci numbers are also closely related to Lucas numbers, which obey the same recurrence relation and with the Fibonacci numbers form a complementary pair of Lucas sequences.\\n\\n    The Fibonacci numbers may be defined by the recurrence relation F[0]=0, F[1]=1, and F[n]=F[n-1]+F[n-2] for n > 1.\\n\\n    The first 20 Fibonacci numbers Fn are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181.\\n\\n    </material>\\n    <algorithm id=\"1\">\\n        <title>\\n            Fibonacci function\\n        </title>\\n        <inputs>\\n            n: the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate\\n        </inputs>\\n        <outputs>\\n            A list of the first `n` Fibonacci numbers\\n        </outputs>\\n        <steps>\\n            1.

Use a loop to iterate from 0 to `n-1`.\\n            4. In each iteration, calculate the next Fibonacci number by adding `a` and `b`. We recall that the Fibonacci sequence is defined as F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.\\n            5. Update `a` and `b` to the next two Fibonacci numbers.\\n            6.

For example, test with `n=5` and `n=10` where the expected output is `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]` and `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]` respectively.\\n        2. Test the function with negative values of `n` to ensure it handles invalid input correctly.

The user also wants specific test cases with exact coordinates for various depths.\\n\\nFirst, I should understand what a Hilbert curve is. From my previous knowledge, it\\'s a continuous fractal space-filling curve. It starts at one corner of a square and ends at another, filling the entire space without crossing itself. Each iteration increases its complexity, covering more points.\\n\\nI remember that the Hilbert curve can be generated recursively. The base case for depth 0 is just two points: (0,0) and (1,0). For each subsequent depth, the curve is divided into four quadrants, and the recursive function builds each part in a specific order—like moving through the quadrants in a certain sequence.\\n\\nSo, I\\'ll need a recursive approach. The function will take the current depth and the current coordinates as parameters. At each step, it will handle one of the four quadrants based on the recursion level.\\n\\nI also need to plot this curve using matplotlib. That means I\\'ll have to collect all the points generated by the Hilbert curve and then plot them in order. Since matplotlib can\\'t easily handle dynamic updates for recursive functions, I\\'ll precompute all the points first and then plot them all at once.\\n\\nFor the tests, the user wants exact coordinates for various depths. So, I should include test cases for different depths (like 1, 2, 3) and verify that the generated points match the expected sequences.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I\\'ll structure the code into two main functions: one recursive to generate the points and another to plot them. The recursive function will handle each quadrant by adjusting the coordinates and depth until reaching the base case. The plotting function will call this generator, collect all points, and then use matplotlib\\'s plot and show methods to display the curve.\\n\\nI should also consider edge cases, like depth 0, which only has two points. Additionally, I\\'ll need to ensure that the generated points are correct for each test case so that the user can verify the functionality without issues.\\n</think>\\n\\n```xml\\n<root>\\n    <request>\\n    Write a Python code that plots the Hilbert curve for any depth using matplotlib.

The basic steps for generating the curve are:\\n    1. Start at one corner of the square.\\n    2. Divide the square into four smaller squares (quadrants).\\n    3.

The solution should include test cases with exact coordinates for various depths.\\n    </request>\\n    <material>\\n        The Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve, first described by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1895. It is a recursive curve that visits every point in a square grid exactly once and is often used in computer science for its locality-preserving properties. The curve can be generated to any depth (or order), with each level of recursion increasing the complexity of the curve.\\n\\n        The generation of Hilbert curve coordinates involves mapping integers to 2D points through a series of bitwise operations and transformations. For a given depth `n`, the curve will have `2^(2n)` points, forming a grid of size `(2^n x 2^n)`. Each point on the curve can be determined by converting its index into binary, manipulating the bits to account for the Hilbert pattern, and then transforming these bits back into coordinates.\\n\\n        The algorithm involves:\\n        1. Converting each integer from `0` to `2^(2n)-1` into a binary string of length `2n`.\\n        2. Reversing the first half of the binary string.\\n        3. Splitting the reversed string into two halves, which represent the x and y coordinates.\\n        4. Converting these binary strings back into integers to get the final coordinates.\\n\\n        This process ensures that each point on the grid is visited exactly once in a continuous path, forming the Hilbert curve.\\n\\n        The implementation will use matplotlib for plotting the curve by connecting consecutive points with line segments. Additionally, test cases will be provided to verify the correctness of the generated coordinates against known values for various depths.\\n    </material>\\n    <algorithm id=\"1\">\\n        <title>\\n            Generate Hilbert Curve Coordinates\\n        </title>\\n        <inputs>\\n            - depth: An integer representing the recursion depth (order) of the Hilbert curve.\\n        </inputs>\\n        <outputs>\\n            - A list of tuples containing the coordinates of the Hilbert curve points.\\n        </outputs>\\n        <steps>\\n            1.

A [Hilbert curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve) is a\\ncontinuous\\n[space-filling curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve)\\nthat lets you map from a single dimension into multiple dimensions.\\nIn two dimensions, you get curves that look like this:\\n\\n[![2d Hilbert Curves](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrincetonLIPS/numpy-hilbert-curve/main/examples/example_2d.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrincetonLIPS/numpy-hilbert-curve/main/examples/example_2d.png)\\n\\nIn three dimensions, you get curves that look like this:\\n\\n[![3d Hilbert Curves](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrincetonLIPS/numpy-hilbert-curve/main/examples/example_3d.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrincetonLIPS/numpy-hilbert-curve/main/examples/example_3d.png)\\n\\nThis is working entirely in terms of integers, so the size of the (hyper-)\\ncube reflects the number of bits per dimension. You could normalize this to put\\nit into the unit hypercube with floating point numbers.\\n\\nThe mechanics of the implementation rely on the Gray-code \"correction\"\\nprocedure presented in\\n\\n> Skilling, J. (2004, April). Programming the Hilbert curve. In AIP Conference\\n> Proceedings (Vol. 707, No. 1, pp. 381-387). American Institute of Physics.\\n\\nThis paper does a lot of bit twiddling in C. I replicate this with\\n\"bool-twiddling\" in numpy, but of course numpy represents a bool value with 8\\nbits, so don\\'t expect it to really have the same performance as the equivalent\\nC code. However, my goal here (rather than write it in Cython) was to make it\\neasy to integrate with code you\\'re already writing in Python with numpy.\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nYou can install this via PyPI:\\n\\n```\\n$ pip install numpy-hilbert-curve\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nThe basic usage looks like this:\\n\\n```\\nimport numpy as np\\nfrom hilbert import decode, encode\\n\\n# Turn an ndarray of Hilber integers into locations.\\n# 2 is the number of dimensions, 3 is the number of bits per dimension\\nlocs = decode(np.array([1,2,3]), 2, 3)\\n\\nprint(locs)\\n# prints [[0 1]\\n#         [1 1]\\n#         [1 0]]\\n\\n# You can go the other way also, of course.\\nH = encode(locs, 2, 3)\\n\\nprint(H)\\n# prints array([1, 2, 3], dtype=uint64)\\n```\\n\\nThe reason things like Hilbert curves are interesting is because they preserve\\nsome amount of locality. In this figure, I\\'m gradually changing the color in\\nthe Hilbert integers, using the \"copper\" colormap:\\n\\n[![2d Color Hilbert Curves](https://github.com/PrincetonLIPS/numpy-hilbert-curve/raw/main/examples/example_2d_color.png)](https://github.com/PrincetonLIPS/numpy-hilbert-curve/raw/main/examples/example_2d_color.png)\\n\\nIn this picture, I\\'m doing the same thing in 3d:\\n\\n[![3d Color Hilbert Curves](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d68e472206ad3527ff9e172d15796d6cf4536cf3cb5f53ce35d3ea5f1d808390/68747470733a2f2f7777772e63732e7072696e6365746f6e2e6564752f7e7270612f726f746174655f33645f35626974735f636f6d707265737365642e676966)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d68e472206ad3527ff9e172d15796d6cf4536cf3cb5f53ce35d3ea5f1d808390/68747470733a2f2f7777772e63732e7072696e6365746f6e2e6564752f7e7270612f726f746174655f33645f35626974735f636f6d707265737365642e676966)\\n\\n## About\\n\\nNumpy implementation of Hilbert curves in arbitrary dimensions\\n\\n### Resources\\n\\n[Readme](#readme-ov-file)\\n\\n### License\\n\\n[MIT license](#MIT-1-ov-file)\\n\\n\\n\\n[Activity](/PrincetonLIPS/numpy-hilbert-curve/activity)\\n\\n[Custom properties](/PrincetonLIPS/numpy-hilbert-curve/custom-properties)\\n\\n### Stars\\n\\n[**167**\\nstars](/PrincetonLIPS/numpy-hilbert-curve/stargazers)\\n\\n### Watchers\\n\\n[**5**\\nwatching](/PrincetonLIPS/numpy-hilbert-curve/watchers)\\n\\n### Forks\\n\\n[**19**\\nforks](/PrincetonLIPS/numpy-hilbert-curve/forks)\\n\\n[Report repository](/contact/report-content?content_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FPrincetonLIPS%2Fnumpy-hilbert-curve&report=PrincetonLIPS+%28user%29)\\n\\n## [Releases](/PrincetonLIPS/numpy-hilbert-curve/releases)\\n\\nNo releases published\\n\\n## [Packages 0](/orgs/PrincetonLIPS/packages?repo_name=numpy-hilbert-curve)\\n\\nNo packages published\\n\\n## Languages\\n\\n* [Python\\n  100.0%](/PrincetonLIPS/numpy-hilbert-curve/search?l=python)\\n\\n## Footer\\n\\n© 2025 GitHub,\\xa0Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can’t perform that action at this time.'),\n",

A [Hilbert curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve) is a\\ncontinuous\\n[space-filling curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve)\\nthat lets you map from a single dimension into multiple dimensions.\\nIn two dimensions, you get curves that look like this:\\n\\n[![2d Hilbert Curves](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrincetonLIPS/numpy-hilbert-curve/main/examples/example_2d.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrincetonLIPS/numpy-hilbert-curve/main/examples/example_2d.png)\\n\\nIn three dimensions, you get curves that look like this:\\n\\n[![3d Hilbert Curves](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrincetonLIPS/numpy-hilbert-curve/main/examples/example_3d.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrincetonLIPS/numpy-hilbert-curve/main/examples/example_3d.png)\\n\\nThis is working entirely in terms of integers, so the size of the (hyper-)\\ncube reflects the number of bits per dimension. You could normalize this to put\\nit into the unit hypercube with floating point numbers.\\n\\nThe mechanics of the implementation rely on the Gray-code \"correction\"\\nprocedure presented in\\n\\n> Skilling, J. (2004, April). Programming the Hilbert curve. In AIP Conference\\n> Proceedings (Vol. 707, No. 1, pp. 381-387). American Institute of Physics.\\n\\nThis paper does a lot of bit twiddling in C. I replicate this with\\n\"bool-twiddling\" in numpy, but of course numpy represents a bool value with 8\\nbits, so don\\'t expect it to really have the same performance as the equivalent\\nC code. However, my goal here (rather than write it in Cython) was to make it\\neasy to integrate with code you\\'re already writing in Python with numpy.\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nYou can install this via PyPI:\\n\\n```\\n$ pip install numpy-hilbert-curve\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nThe basic usage looks like this:\\n\\n```\\nimport numpy as np\\nfrom hilbert import decode, encode\\n\\n# Turn an ndarray of Hilber integers into locations.\\n# 2 is the number of dimensions, 3 is the number of bits per dimension\\nlocs = decode(np.array([1,2,3]), 2, 3)\\n\\nprint(locs)\\n# prints [[0 1]\\n#         [1 1]\\n#         [1 0]]\\n\\n# You can go the other way also, of course.\\nH = encode(locs, 2, 3)\\n\\nprint(H)\\n# prints array([1, 2, 3], dtype=uint64)\\n```\\n\\nThe reason things like Hilbert curves are interesting is because they preserve\\nsome amount of locality. In this figure, I\\'m gradually changing the color in\\nthe Hilbert integers, using the \"copper\" colormap:\\n\\n[![2d Color Hilbert Curves](https://github.com/PrincetonLIPS/numpy-hilbert-curve/raw/main/examples/example_2d_color.png)](https://github.com/PrincetonLIPS/numpy-hilbert-curve/raw/main/examples/example_2d_color.png)\\n\\nIn this picture, I\\'m doing the same thing in 3d:\\n\\n[![3d Color Hilbert Curves](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d68e472206ad3527ff9e172d15796d6cf4536cf3cb5f53ce35d3ea5f1d808390/68747470733a2f2f7777772e63732e7072696e6365746f6e2e6564752f7e7270612f726f746174655f33645f35626974735f636f6d707265737365642e676966)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d68e472206ad3527ff9e172d15796d6cf4536cf3cb5f53ce35d3ea5f1d808390/68747470733a2f2f7777772e63732e7072696e6365746f6e2e6564752f7e7270612f726f746174655f33645f35626974735f636f6d707265737365642e676966)\\n\\n## Footer\\n\\n© 2025 GitHub,\\xa0Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can’t perform that action at this time.')]"
